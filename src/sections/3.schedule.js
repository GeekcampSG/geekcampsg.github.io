                GovTechâ€™s Digital Operations Smart Services (DOSS) platform uses
                deep learning to develop smart sensors and autonomous robotics.
                The robot dog SPOT and smart thermal scanner SPOTON were both
                developed on the DOSS platform. Jia Yi will share his
                experiences developing DOSS and plans for the platform.

                At some point in our developer careers, we've all looked at this
                intimidating window of darkness called the terminal. Despite its
                efficiency & power, many choose GUIs instead. Adrienne will
                demystify the terminal, from its origins up to its powerful
                commands. You'll leave a new fan of the terminal!

                Most of the time we treat compilers as black boxes but what
                really goes on under the hood? In this demo, I will demonstrate
                a DSL for writing compilers and a compiler-compiler that turns
                the DSL into a compiler. Amazingly, we can describe the
                compiler-compiler itself in only 26 lines of the DSL.

                Browser & Web APIs along with JavaScript have seen an incredible
