              Local tech communities are most welcome to present a talk and get involved!
            </p>
            <p>
              Rally your community to submit talk proposals relevant to your interest areas.
              There are limited slots for both headline and parallel tracks,
              so submit early to avoid disappointment!
              If your talk is accepted, we will work closely with you to promote it to GeekcampSG
              attendees and our social media.
            </p>
            <p>
              For more information, get in touch with the organiser who contacted you. :)
