              We would love to invite the local tech communities to present a talk!
            </p>
            <p>
              Rally your community to submit talk proposals relevant to your community. 
              We do have limited slots for Headline and parallel tracks, 
              so it will be on a first come first serve basis. 
              We will work closely with you to promote your meetup group to GeekcampSG 
              attendees and our social media
            </p>

            <p>
              For more information, you may contact any of the organisers you know :)
