How does it fit in with microservices? In this talk, we will explore these questions and more. We will look beyond the hype to grasp what serverless really is.</p>

                                  <p>We use software regularly without thinking too much of it, but do you wonder how it all came to be? Turing was the first person to realize that by using different software a single machine can be made to perform any task. In this talk, we will demonstrate his insight through a series of demos.</p>

                                  <p>Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) is an Open Source hardware device (open on all layers) that can be used for experiments by teachers, students and citizen scientists to learn and teach electronics. The hardware comes with a firmware, desktop app, android app - all open source. This tiny pocket lab provides an array of sensors for doing science and engineering experiments. It comes with functions of numerous measurement devices including an oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and as a data logger. During this session, Wai Gie will speak about the project development and current use cases of the device through a short demo. </p>

And how is it, that our old friend Java, which runs on a ‚ÄúVM‚Äù, can almost compete with native compiled languages? The answer partially is due to JIT (Just In Time) compilation.</p>

          <h2 class="header-title">üí° Conference Code of Conduct üôè</h2>
          <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
          <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
          <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
          <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
          <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
          <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>
          <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
          <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
          <h3>Need help?</h3>
          <p>You have our contact details in the emails we've sent. Please feel free to approach (a few designated people we appointed to handle, emails here) to report any incidents. Rest assured it will be kept confidental.</p>
