In this talk, we will explore these questions and more. We will look beyond the hype to grasp what serverless really is.</p>

            <p>What exactly makes Javascript so much faster than other dynamic languages? Or why is Pypy so much faster than CPython? And how is it, that our old friend Java, which runs on a “VM”, can almost compete with native compiled languages? The answer partially is due to JIT (Just In Time) compilation.</p>

            <p>Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) is an Open Source hardware device (open on all layers) that can be used for experiments by teachers, students and citizen scientists to learn and teach electronics. The hardware comes with a firmware, desktop app, android app - all open source. This tiny pocket lab provides an array of sensors for doing science and engineering experiments. It comes with functions of numerous measurement devices including an oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and as a data logger. During this session, Wai Gie will speak about the project development and current use cases of the device through a short demo.</p>
